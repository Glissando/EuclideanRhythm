A project written for a demonstration of Euclidean Rhythms, a topic introduced by Godfried Toussaint, inspired by his paper
[The Euclidean Algorithm generates Traditional Music Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf)
Information on the Bjorklund algorithms implementation details can be found [here](https://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/timing/Rep-Rate%20Tech%20Note.pdf)
